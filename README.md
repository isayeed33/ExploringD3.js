To open an HTML file, you can follow these steps:

Locate the HTML File: Navigate to the directory where your HTML file is saved. You can use your computer's file explorer (Finder on macOS or File Explorer on Windows) to browse through folders and find your HTML file.

Double-Click: Once you've located the HTML file, simply double-click on it. This action should open the file in your default web browser.

Alternatively, Open with Browser: If double-clicking doesn't work, you can right-click on the HTML file and select "Open with" from the context menu. Choose your preferred web browser from the list of available options.

Drag and Drop: Another method is to open your web browser first and then drag the HTML file from your file explorer into the browser window. This action should load the HTML file in the browser.
